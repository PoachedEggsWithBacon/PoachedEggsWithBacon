# Hi, there! I'm Mark!

- 👋 Hi, I’m Mark (AKA @PoachedEggsWithBacon)!
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Web Development, AI / ML, Data Science, Information Sciences (especially in the laboratory), as well as all other sciences, mathematics, and philosophies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various deployment strategies for REST APIs and web apps, especially lightweight, quick-to-launch Flask applications using Gunicorn, Nginx, Postgres, and Docker.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything. All help is welcome and I am willing to assist where I can.
- 📫 How to reach me... That's a good question... TBD...
